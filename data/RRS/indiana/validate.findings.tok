xxxx xxxx and lateral chest examination was obtained the heart silhouette and mediastinal contours are not enlarged lungs demonstrate no acute findings there is no effusion or pneumothorax
the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears irregular secondary to the diffuse bilateral pulmonary interstitial disease the thoracic aorta is tortuous calcified lymph xxxx are demonstrated in the left hilum no focal pulmonary consolidation diffuse increased bilateral pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with the patient s history of known pulmonary fibrosis with relative sparing of the bilateral lung apices no pneumothorax or pleural effusion demonstrated the thoracic spine appears intact
