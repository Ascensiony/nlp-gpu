1 partial reaccumulation of left pleural effusion now moderate in size 2 diffuse reticulonodular opacities possibly due to pulmonary edema but atypical or opportunistic infection is an additional consideration given the nodular appearance if persistent after diuresis consider a ct scan for further characterization to exclude a miliary nodular infection 3 patchy and linear opacities in left mid and lower lung may be due to atelectasis or infectious consolidation
