the lungs are clear cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal in size there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion visualized osseous structures are unremarkable no free air is identified diaphragm
the lungs are clear of focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax flattening of the diaphragms likely reflects chronic pulmonary disease the heart size is normal the mediastinal contours are normal there are no signs of latent or active tuberculosis
there are relatively low lung volumes mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen there is no focal consolidation no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged the aorta is calcified and tortuous

pa and lateral views of the chest the lungs are clear cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable
there is persistent severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement dual lead left sided pacer device is stable in position no focal consolidation is seen there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax no overt pulmonary edema is seen
since there has been interval placement of a left pectoral pacemaker with transvenous leads seen in the right atrium right ventricle and a left coronary vein the lungs are clear mild to moderate bibasilar atelectasis is noted no pneumothorax the median sternotomy wires are intact and aligned patient is status post aortic valve and mitral valve repair
severe cardiomegaly is stable pacer leads are in standard position in the right atrium right ventricle and through the coronary sinus there is no pneumothorax there is no pleural effusion patient is status post aortic valve and mitral valve repair
the lungs are clear without focal consolidation no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable
an et tube terminates 3 cm above the carina and ng tube passes inferiorly off the image in the expected region of the stomach the lungs are well expanded diffusely increased interstitial markings are again seen along with engorged pulmonary vasculature and cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with moderate pulmonary edema increased opacity at the left lung base compared to prior likely reflects atelectasis no focal consolidation is seen there is no pneumothorax
the right ij central venous catheter has been removed there is no pneumothorax mild to moderate pulmonary edema has increased since the prior exam small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged the patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiomegaly there is generalized osteopenia
a new right ij central line terminates in the mid to low svc the et tube and ng tube are unchanged from prior exam the lungs are well expanded diffusely increased interstitial markings are again noted in the lungs bilaterally along with engorged pulmonary vasculature cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with moderate pulmonary edema similar to prior exams opacity at the left lung base is again noted consistent with atelectasis no focal consolidation is seen and there is no pneumothorax
the lungs are well expanded diffusely increased interstitial markings pulmonary vasculature engorgement cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions are seen consistent with moderate pulmonary edema no focal consolidation is seen there is no pneumothorax
cardiac silhouette size is normal mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged pulmonary vasculature is normal lungs are clear no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present no acute osseous abnormalities are visualized
the lungs are clear without focal consolidation no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
the lungs are clear the cardiac hilar and mediastinal contours are normal no pleural abnormality is seen
pa and lateral views of the chest provided there is no focal consolidation effusion or pneumothorax the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal imaged osseous structures are intact no free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen
heart size is normal the mediastinal and hilar contours are normal the pulmonary vasculature is normal lungs are clear no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen
the lung volumes are low there are bibasilar linear opacities atelectasis and or consolidation diffuse vascular prominence and cardiomegaly noted no pleural effusion or pneumothorax present ekg leads overlie the anterior chest bony thorax is stable
moderately well inflated lungs with no change in prominence of pulmonary vasculature stable cardiomegaly enlarged left atrial shadow is again identified no pleural effusions or pneumothorax no change in bony thorax
the cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours appears unchanged there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax parenchymal abnormalities appear unchanged and reflect emphysema with mild accompanying interstitial disease subpleural scarring and a small hyperdense nodules at the right lung apex appear unchanged scarring and bullous changes are also stable at the base of the left chest the chest is hyperinflated there has been no significant change
there is mild interstitial edema and the heart is normal in size a left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
parenchymal abnormality including emphysema with mild interstitial disease appears stable there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema scarring at the left lung base also unchanged no pleural effusion or pneumothorax mild cardiomegaly is noted the aortic knob is calcified
frontal and lateral views of the chest show no acute intrathoracic process flattened diaphragms and pulmonary blebs are consistent with obstructive lung disease the mediastinum and pleural structures are unremarkable calcifications are seen within the aortic arch the shoulders are not fully evaluated however there are no suspicious osseous lesions degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine
