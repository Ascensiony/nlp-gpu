ap portable upright view of the chest evaluation limited due to underpenetration and low lung volumes there is cardiomegaly with hilar congestion and mild pulmonary edema no large effusion is seen the small effusions difficult to exclude no overt signs of pneumonia though lung bases are suboptimally assessed no large pneumothorax
ap and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam from there is engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen peripherally there is no large confluent consolidation or effusion cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged
a single frontal pa radiograph of the chest was taken with the patient in upright position there is mild interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular engorgement no focal airspace consolidation is seen moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged there is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion
there is persistent prominence of the hila suggesting vascular engorgement with possible mild increase in vascular congestion as compared to the prior study no new focal consolidation is seen there is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable

single ap upright portable view of the chest was obtained there are relatively low lung volumes mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged there has been interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes there is pulmonary vascular congestion no large pleural effusions are seen although a trace effusion on the left would be difficult to exclude no pneumothorax is seen the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged
lung volumes are low with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings there is however superimposed pulmonary edema which may have progressed since prior although changes could in part be to lower lung volumes enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is also noted again not significantly changed more dense left basilar opacity particularly on the frontal view could be combination of atelectasis noting that infection is difficult to exclude
there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is low lying with tip approximately 1 6 cm above the carina an esophageal tube is in place coursing inferior to the diaphragm however tip out of view of the radiograph lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary edema no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged however unchanged

in comparison with the earlier study of this date the endotracheal tube lies approximately 5 cm above the carina bibasilar opacities persist more prominent on the left and most likely representing atelectasis and small effusion in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach and central catheter tip is in the lower portion of the svc stable cardiomegaly
